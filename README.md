# Character-level-Language-Model
Generating Shakespeare Using a Character-level Language Model

![Shakespeare](https://i.imgur.com/81YZuel.jpg)

## Overview
This project implements a character-level language model to generate Shakespearean-style text using PyTorch. The model is trained on a dataset of Shakespeare's works and utilizes a recurrent neural network (GRU) to predict the next character in a sequence.

## Features
- Character-based language modeling
- Implemented using PyTorch
- GRU-based recurrent neural network
- Generates text in Shakespearean style
- Supports GPU acceleration

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch unidecode
```

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Shakespeare's texts obtained from:

```
https://github.com/tau-nlp-course/NLP_HW2/raw/main/data/shakespeare.txt
```

We preprocess the data using the `unidecode` package to convert Unicode characters to ASCII.

## Model Architecture
The model consists of:
1. **Embedding Layer**: Maps characters to learned vector representations.
2. **GRU Layer**: Processes sequences and captures contextual dependencies.
3. **Output Layer**: Predicts the probability distribution of the next character.

## Training
The training process involves:
1. Converting text into numerical tensors.
2. Using a loss function to minimize prediction errors.
3. Updating the model weights using backpropagation.

Run the training loop using:

```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    inp, target = random_training_set()
    loss = train(inp, target)
    print(f"Epoch {epoch}, Loss: {loss}")
```

## Text Generation
Once trained, the model can generate Shakespeare-like text by predicting characters iteratively:

```python
print(evaluate(prime_str="To be, or not to be", predict_len=200))
```

## Advantages
### Character-Based Model:
âœ… Can generate words not seen in training data.
âœ… More flexible for different text styles.

### Word-Based Model:
âœ… Faster training and inference.
âœ… Better for languages with large vocabularies.

## Usage
To use the model, ensure all dependencies are installed and run the Jupyter Notebook with:
